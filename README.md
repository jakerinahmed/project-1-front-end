[Visit wroteIt](https://resilient-frangipane-39c540.netlify.app/)



## What is wroteIt?
wroteIt is a wesbite where users can anonymously post blog entries, comment on other journal entries and react to other entries. The website is largely influenced by the popular discussion website Reddit.

## Installation and usage
* Clone the repo
* In the terminal write `npm install`
* To run localhost, type `npm run dev`

## Technologies
* The website design was created using HTML/CSS
* The API was built using JavaScript
* The client-side was deployed using [Netlify](https://resilient-frangipane-39c540.netlify.app/)
* The API was hosted on [Heroku](https://wrote-it-babole.herokuapp.com/)
* Testing was done using [Jest Testing Framework](https://jestjs.io/)

## Process
* The website design was the first issue we tackled. We wanted the website to be very simple and minamalist with almost no clutter with the only content being the entries and the comments. This was to engage the users entire focus to the entries and the discussion.

* The server-side was the next focus where the API was built using JavaScript then hosted on Heroku.

* Functionality was added to the client side where we tackled the homepage > view entries page > create entry page
